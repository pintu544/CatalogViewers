<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>When you open the app, it will display the first image in the collection along with its title and description on the right side of the screen. You can navigate between images using the previous and next buttons underneath the image, or by clicking on a thumbnail image below the main image.</p>
<p>If you click on the next button when the last image is showing, it will cycle back to the first image. Similarly, if you click on the previous button when the first image is showing, it will cycle back to the last image.</p>
<p>There is also a play/pause button that alternately starts and stops the automatic display of images in the carousel. When the slideshow is active, images are displayed for a 3 second interval before automatically switching to the next image. If you click on any carousel indicator or the previous or next button while the slideshow is active, it will load the appropriate image and continue the slideshow from that image.</p>
<p>When you click on a thumbnail image, it will display that image along with its title and description on the right side of the screen. The currently selected thumbnail image will be highlighted, and others will be shown in grayscale.</p>
